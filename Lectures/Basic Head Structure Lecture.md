# How to draw the head ðŸ¤¯
---
Based on this excellent [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T7cDY7YDsg)
## My 2 cents 
- Treat the head as the first [[Gesture]] of the body
- Ear placement can help with perspective 
## Structure 
1. 2 major anatomical structures 
	1. skull 
	2. feature mask 
2. from a profile Skull forms an egg 
3. more spherical from front or back 
4. you can play with shapes to give different character to the head. 
>[!warning] Don't make shapes too similar or you lose clarity of the larger form
5. We want simplicity so we can work quickly. 
6. we also want it to be characteristic.
7. Think like a sculptor. 
## Gesture ðŸ¤Œ

>[!tip] Size of skull
>From profile we want the skull to be more egg shaped. Otherwise the head looks alien 

- Egg shape gives sense of movement towards the back of the head. 
- Their are two main gestures of the head.

ðŸ”´ The Primary Gesture which flows into the rest of the drawing. 

ðŸ”µ The secondary Gesture which helps keep [[Structure]] of the head feeling normal. 
# Construction ðŸ‘·
---
 - The height of the head will be slightly longer than the width (From Profile). 
 
 >[!tip] When in doubt go longer in features as this is more forgiving if you do not get it right. 
 >In western art goofing up by ADDING length will generally look better. 

- From the front the head is more of a 2:3 ratio. where as profile is only slightly rectangular because of the secondary gesture. 
### Proportions
- Ears in the middle third. 
- The eye is roughly half way of the whole head. 
- Half way between eye line and chin is root of nose. 
- half way between nose and chin is lower part of the lip.

### Neck Construction tips 
- the digastric plane is what gives depth to the face mask. 
- when drawing the neck their is a little sag on the neck. 
- when drawing the neck only rule is to not make the neck to thick or thin depending on - the characters design 
- neck connect low in front high in the back. 
- neck should connect to the head in the facemask in the front and the skull in the back. 
- from the profile the neck looks more like an hourglass 
- from front more like a tube. 
- from the back the big shape is easier. but placement of details are key. 
- Transition points between features are VERY Important. 
- the length of the neck is usually another 1/3rd from the front 
- trap muscles can be thought of as two cables that connect to the back of the skull 
### Ear Construction ðŸ‘‚
- from the side the ear is at roughly the middle. 
- if the ear is toward the skull were working a 3/4 front view
- closer to the face means 3/4 back view

>Planes make for good indication of direction 
>spheres make for good indication of volume
